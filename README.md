# Art Puzzles - National Art Gallery Appreciation Game

Welcome to Art Puzzles, the National Art Gallery Appreciation Game! This repository contains the source code and assets for an interactive experience, developed by Argyrios Savvas, as part of a university assignment at Ionio University's Department of Audio & Visual Arts.

## Overview
The primary goal of this project is for people to engage and acknowledge the beauty of art through various interactive elements, including games, puzzles, and riddles. The culmination of the experience results in a curated collection of famous artworks from the National Art Gallery.

## Game Description
Art Puzzles is designed to provide a unique and enjoyable way for users to appreciate art actively. Players progress through 7 stages, each featuring a random number of artworks. To unlock these artworks, players must solve puzzles and win a recreation of the famous game Guitar Hero.

### How to Play
- **Solve Puzzles:** Navigate through the stages by solving puzzles. Puzzles are the key to unlocking the artworks in each stage.
